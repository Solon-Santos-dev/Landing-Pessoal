            <p>So, my history in programming is not that long, but it's been a few years.

                I've always liked the area of ​​information technology, and for some time now I've been identifying myself a lot with the area of ​​systems analysis and development, including deciding to start this college almost 2 years ago.
                
                Well, I found out what most programmers say: "College won't teach you how to be a real programmer." I saw this in practice, in a very clear way.
                
                With this understanding, I went on to personal study in some courses with technologies that were a little more advanced than the ones I was studying. This decision helped me understand that to dedicate yourself to this area, it takes a lot of effort and determination. We need focus and persistence, because only with daily practice, progress will come.
                
                I'm here, it's almost midnight on a Tuesday, and yes, I'm coding. To give up? Never. As long as I can breathe, I will chase my dreams. And one of them is to become a successful software engineer.
