            <strong>Experiente Number One:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>So, my history in programming is not that long, but it's been a few years.
                

                I've always liked the area of ​​information technology, and for some time now I've been identifying myself a lot with the area of ​​systems analysis and development, including deciding to start this college almost 2 years ago.
                
                Well, I found out what most programmers say: "College won't teach you how to be a real programmer." I saw this in practice, in a very clear way.
                
                With this understanding, I went on to personal study in some courses with technologies that were a little more advanced than the ones I was studying. This decision helped me understand that to dedicate yourself to this area, it takes a lot of effort and determination. We need focus and persistence, because only with daily practice, progress will come.
                
                I'm here, it's almost midnight on a Tuesday, and yes, I'm coding. To give up? Never. As long as I can breathe, I will chase my dreams. And one of them is to become a successful software engineer.
                
                </p>
                <br>
            <strong>Experience Number Two:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>With this big desire and dream, i'm really focusing now. I know that i's hard, but not impossible. 

                It's a little funny, because when i was a little boy i liked technologie a lot, and my family and friends next to me saw that.
                
                So, step by step i was growing, and that dream in my heart don't stopped to grow too. Now, i'm adult. I'm married with the best wife in this whole world. And i'm so grateful for that.
                
                As a Web Developer, i hope to learn more about especifics technologies of the front-end. But, i really like the majority areas inside the are of Web developer, and in the future i will decide better what the area i will focus more and specialize.
                Now, i'm focusing in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
